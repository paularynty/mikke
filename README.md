# [Mikke: Japanese Kanji app](https://mikke-kanji.vercel.app)

Mikke is a quick, low-threshold way to look up kanji (Japanese characters/ideograms adapted from Chinese characters). The app is aimed at people with already some knowledge of kanji. App has been built with Next.js, React library and TypeScript.

## Overview

The app allows kanji search by English word, as well as displays a full kanji list. By clicking on any kanji in the search result or list, various information about the respective kanji is displayed, such as meaning, onyomi/kunyomi (Chinese/Japanese) readings, and stroke count.
